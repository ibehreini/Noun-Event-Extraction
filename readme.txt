NLP Event Noun Extraction GSS Resources

What is an ‘event noun’?
For the purposes of this project, there are two kinds of nouns. Object nouns are things like ‘book’, ‘sock’, and ‘school’. Event nouns are things like ‘wedding’, ‘funeral’, ‘mission’, and ‘bombing’.

What is a lemma?
A lemma is the root of a word. For instance, the lemma of ‘blockades’ is ‘blockade’. Simply put, it’s the word stripped of tense.

What is POS?
The data we will use is pre-processed by StanfordNLP. POS means Part of Speech. You can find a complete list of the POS tag abbreviations and what they mean here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1833252/java-stanford-nlp-part-of-speech-labels

What are dependency relations?
Dependency relations are central to this project. In short, they are a way of organizing sentences into ‘governor’ words and ‘dependent’ words. Learn more with these resources and ask questions!

You should just skim these and look at examples.

Know how to:
	Declare variables/arrays
	Conditionals
	Loops
	Printing/returning

Since you’ve all had prior coding experience, picking up python is a matter of learning new syntax. Feel free to use google and websites like Stack Overflow if you forget certain aspects of it.

We will also be working with [one for now but potentially more] XML files. Get familiar with how this file works. I’ll also provide the plain text so you can compare the structures.

Please check out the xml file. Also, the xml.gz file is the compressed version
And open the xml file. It is quite large so you might want to open in from terminal using the ‘less afp_eng_199407.xml’ (make sure you cd into the proper directory !) If you need more information about command line tips, let me know!

It is important that you understand the flagging system and structure of this XML file. Focus on a single sentence of the document and follow how the XML file makes it easy to identity each word’s lemma, POS, and dependency relation!

Questions:
-	Find a sentence with an event noun. What words/syntactic structure lends itself to this event noun?
-	How do you think we should go about looking for event nouns?
Feedback:
I’d love to know how you’re doing! Answer these questions and feel free to email me your responses. Alternatively, you can direct message me in Slack.
